# Lazy Turnip
This is a world of warcraft addon manager that uses wowinterface and curse for getting addons.

I'm not in any way affiliated with Blizzard Entertainment, and neither is this program.

## Usage
To install from source.
So far only scripts for windows.

* install node
* clone repo 'git clone https://github.com/Auo/lazy-turnip.git'
* run 'npm install'
* run 'npm run build-windows' creates and executable
* run 'npm run build-installer-windows' if you want to have an installer.
* either run .exe or install for later use!
